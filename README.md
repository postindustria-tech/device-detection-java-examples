[Developer Documentation](https://51degrees.com/device-detection-java/index.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=documentation&utm_campaign=java-open-source "developer documentation")

## Introduction

These examples are not distributed as maven jars and need to be built by you.

This project contains sub-modules - **console**, giving examples that are intended 
to be run from the command line/console and **web**, illustrating use
of 51Degrees Web/Servlet integration. There is also a **shared** sub-module
containing various helpers for the examples.

Among other things, the examples illustrate:
- use of the fluent builder to configure a pipeline
- use of a configuration options file to configure a pipeline
- use of the cloud device detection service
- use of the on-premise "hash" device detection service
- use of device detection pipeline for off-line processing tasks
- configuring device detection trade-offs between speed and conserving memory

## Cloud resource keys

You will require [resource keys](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_info__resource_keys.html)
to use the Cloud API, as described on our website. Get resource keys from
our [configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com/), see our [documentation](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_concepts__configurator.html) on
how to use this.
 
A resource key configured with the properties needed
to run most of the examples can be obtained [here](https://configure.51degrees.com/jqz435Nc). 
To use the resource key in the example it can be supplied as a
command line parameter, pasted into the configuration file (where there is one)
or supplied as either an environment variable or a system
property called "TestResourceKey".

Some cloud examples require an enhanced resource key containing a license key. And some
on-premise examples require you to provide a license key. You can find out about 
resource keys and license keys at our [pricing page](https://51degrees.com/pricing). 

## Running examples with changes to Pipeline packages

A common use case is to make a change to the Pipeline logic in
device-detection-java and then use these examples to observe the results of the
change.

By default, the examples are configured to use the packages from Maven central.
In order to produce and use local packages instead:

- Clone and make your changes to device-detection-java
- Set the version of the device detection packages that we're going to create to 0.0.0:
  `mvn versions:set-property -Dproperty="project.version" "-DnewVersion=0.0.0"`
- Create and install the packages locally (skipping tests is needed):
  `mvn clean install [-DskipTests]`
- Modify the POM for the examples to reference these new local packages. This can
  be done by editing the POM directly or by using the command line:
  `mvn versions:set-property -Dproperty="device-detection.version" "-DnewVersion=0.0.0"`

The same principle can be applied to incorporate changes in pipeline-java if needed.

## Running built examples from command line

Running

```bash
mvn package
```

will produce "fat" JARs inside `target` subfolders.

Use them with relevant example class entrypoints like:

```bash
java -cp .\console\target\device-detection-java-examples.console-4.4.20-jar-with-dependencies.jar fiftyone.devicedetection.examples.console.OfflineProcessing
```
